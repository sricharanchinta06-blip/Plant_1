# 🌿 Medicinal Plant Identification App 🌿

This project is a Streamlit web application that identifies medicinal plants from leaf images. It utilizes a pre-trained Keras model to predict the species of the plant based on the uploaded or selected sample image. The application provides a user-friendly interface for image upload, prediction, and result display, making it easy for anyone to identify medicinal plants.

🚀 **Key Features**

*   **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload leaf images directly through the web interface. 
*   **Sample Image Selection:** Offers a selection of pre-loaded sample images for testing the application. 
*   **Pre-trained Keras Model:** Uses a pre-trained Keras model (`medicinal_plant_model.keras`) for accurate plant identification. 
*   **Real-time Prediction:** Provides prediction results with confidence scores in real-time. 
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and easy-to-use experience. 
*   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles errors such as missing model files or data directories. 
*   **Session State Management:** Uses Streamlit's session state to persist variables across re-runs. 
*   **Class Label Mapping:** Dynamically loads class labels from the data directory to interpret model predictions.
